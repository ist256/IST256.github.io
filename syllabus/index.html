<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>
<p>Office hours are for asking questions, clearing up doubts and misunderstandings in the the coursework and getting advice / guidance on labs and homework. Please to not expect to be tutored during office hours, and please do not work on your homework during our office hours. Each of your instructor&rsquo;s Office Hours will be posted in Blackboard. If you require tutoring, please see the <strong>getting help</strong> section below.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-approach-used-in-this-course">Understanding Approach Used in this Course</h2>
<p>Learning to program a computer does not come easy for most people. Decades of teaching programming to students like yourself has taught me it requires time, patience, practice and a well-established routine.  This is not unlike the same routine required to learn a foreign language or musical instrument. There are times to practice and then times to demonstrate what you have learned.  </p>
<h3 id="spaced-and-repetitive-practice">Spaced and Repetitive Practice</h3>
<p>For better or worse, this course grading is designed to force you to practice. There are various activities due each week: readings, labs, and in-class / out-of-class homework activities. These are designed to expose you to programming little each day rather than binging the content once a week. Consuming the material this way gives you multiple points of exposure and most importantly time to process. Practice activities are formative assessments. This means being correct carries the same weight as explaining your struggles when you know you are not correct and seeking help when you need it.  </p>
<h3 id="building-habit-through-routine">Building Habit Through Routine</h3>
<p>Another thing we do to help you to be successful is to impose a routine upon you. The course material is conceptually difficult so we try to remove some of the logistics from learning by providing the same structure week to week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before the main section lecture you are exposed to the topic through <strong>reading and video assignments</strong>. The focus is on understanding the concepts.</li>
<li>During the <strong>main section lecture</strong> you observe and ask questions. You do not need write code at this point. The focus is on reading code, understanding the concepts as applied through code, learning how the code executes, and asking questions.</li>
<li>The <strong>lab assignments</strong> help you to practice writing code for the first time. This is done in a guided fashion. You are given short, specific problems to solve with code. For each lab, a guidance video is provided to those who require it.  The completed lab is submitted as evidence that you practiced and include what you have learned.  </li>
<li>During your <strong>recitation</strong>, we focus on problem solving and writing solutions with code. The problem at this phase are similar complexity as the homework. At this point every student should be writing code, learning to get comfortable writing code and troubleshooting problems. Code written in Recitation must be turned in for a participation grade.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>homework</strong> assignments are your opportunity to demonstrate you can code a solution to a problem on your own. Guidance is provided as to how to approach the problem. Homework assignments are a form of practice so it is expected students will explain what they learned or are still struggling to conceptualize. Expressing your thoughts on the learning experience is an import part of learning itself.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summative-assessments">Summative Assessments</h3>
<p>Summative assessments are no longer about practice. They are about measuring what you have learned. There are two types of summative assessments in this course <strong>exams</strong> and a <strong>project</strong>. There are exams at milestones throughout the course. The project demonstrates you can learn to code independently, then explain your solution to another.</p>
<h3 id="main-session-expectations-mondays">Main Session Expectations (Mondays)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Monday&rsquo;s Large group session, section M001 in a large lecture hall. Because it can be intimidating to ask questions in this forum, you are encouraged to use the class chat offered for this course. The first slide at the beginning of large group will explain how to access the class chat. You are welcome, and encouraged to ask questions or for clarification of concepts during the lecture. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be expected to engage in class by participating in class-wide polls, quizzes and surveys. Your responses are not graded but they are recorded as a means to measure your participation and engagement in class. Students who do not participate are noted and will be flagged for poor participation in orange success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are encouraged to not try to code as I code, especially if you are a beginner. Instead, watch and ask questions about what you see and experience. It&rsquo;s far too early for most learners to try and code  at this point, and there will be opportunities to do that in small group. Instead you should take nodes and ask questions. Except for the homework solution, the code I write will be made available to you after class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recitation-expectations-wednesdays">Recitation Expectations (Wednesdays)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recitation sessions meet with a fraction of the class. Here you will practice programming and algorithmic problem solving.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are expected to bring your fully-charged laptop to class! You will need to use it to complete in-class exercises. If you do not have your laptop, then you are not prepared for class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be expected to participate in class. This includes sharing your thoughts, ideas, and computer code when you are asked. Some of you might be hesitant to do this, but you need to get over it for your own benefit. Nobody starts out programming as an expert. It takes practice, experimentation, and repeated failure to get it.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be respectful of your instructor and classmates. You are not competing against each other, you are a community. Not everyone learns at the same pace and we should be kind and respectful to our classmates who struggle.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bring-your-own-device">Bring Your Own Device</h3>
<p>This course uses the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) model.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Large Group you need a device to ask and answer questions, basically to participate in group chat and polls (Polley). This can be a smartphone, tablet or laptop (Mac, Windows, or Chromebook). Do not try to code along in large group unless you are experienced. It is best to take notes and ask questions.</li>
<li>For Recitation you need a device for which you can write code in the browser using Jupyter Hub. This should be a laptop computer (Mac, Windows or Chromebook).  You will be expected to bring this device to recitation and use it to write code as part of participating in the recitation.</li>
<li>Since you will code in a web browser using the provided JupyterHub platform, the hardware requirements are minimal. Any laptop, or chromebook should suffice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tutoring">Tutoring</h3>
<p>The University offers free group tutoring for this course through the Center for Learning and Student Success (CLASS).</p>

<h3 id="class-coding-labs-l01-l13">Class Coding Labs (L01 - L13)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each week there will be an out-of-class hands-on lab programming activity.</li>
<li>The purpose of the lab is to provide guided, hands-on programming practice. Labs are your first opportunity to get your hands on a keyboard and start programming. This is a low-stakes assessment, formative assessment. </li>
<li>The <a href="/#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due</a> section of the syllabus identifies the lab you should complete.</li>
<li>You can find the lab activity on JupyterHub.</li>
<li>This activity must be completed and turned submitted by the due date.</li>
<li>You may work alone or with a partner as you complete the lab. If you work with another, you should both complete the lab individually, and you should make a note of who your lab partner was when you completed your work. As to not draw attention to a potential academic integrity violation.</li>
<li>If you are having difficulty completing the lab, you are welcome to review the lab walk-through video which guide you through the more difficult parts of the lab. You are encouraged to only consult the walk-through when you are stuck.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rubric-for-class-coding-labs">Rubric for Class Coding Labs</h4>
<p>Lab Criteria Definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code Correct</strong> means all <code>You Code</code> sections of the lab are correct.</li>
<li><strong>Code Complete</strong> means all <code>You Code</code> sections have an honest attempt to code the problem at hand. Please note this does not imply the code is correct. If the code is not correct, there is an adequate reflection with student questions. </li>
<li><strong>Cells Executed</strong> means all code cells in the lab display evidence they were executed in your lab submission.</li>
<li><strong>Metacognition Complete</strong> means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the lab adequately conveying what you have learned and what still confuses you. This should be evident in the work you have done to complete the lab. We value reflection. It is important to the learning process.</li>

<h3 id="homework-h02-h13">Homework (H02 - H13)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Practice makes perfect. Each week you will be assigned homework to complete outside of class.</li>
<li>The goal of the homework is practice problem solving with code independently. Throughout the process you should take inventory of your abilities with respect to the material. While it is admirable to get the code correct, that is not the evaluation criteria nor is it the purpose of the homework. You should use the homework as a personal gauge for how well you are grasping the material.</li>
<li>You can find the the homework assignments on JupyterHub. The <a href="/#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due</a> section of the syllabus identifies the homework assignment you should complete.</li>
<li>Homework are <strong>individual assignments</strong>. You can collaborate on strategy but you must must work alone on the assignment.  You must be able to explain the code you write, or it will be considered an academic integrity violation. It&rsquo;s not about getting it right, but it is about making an honest self-assessment!</li>
<li>For each homework there is an advice video which provides hints and tips for how you can approach the homework assignment. You are encouraged to only consult the video when you are having difficulty with the homework.</li>
<li>If you get assistance from somewhere else, such as online, or someone else such as a tutor, or the an AI assistant you must divulge that in your submission or it will be considered an academic integrity violation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rubric-for-homework">Rubric for Homework</h4>
<p>Homework Criteria Definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code Correct</strong> means an honest attempt was made at a solution and the solution is correct. For incorrect solutions, the code runs, might not be correct, but there is some explanation in the Metacognition section. </li>
<li><strong>Code Well Written</strong> means your code is easy to understand, modular in nature, has aptly named variables, was programmed in the style we learned in class, and demonstrates what you learned that week. </li>
<li><strong>Problem Analysis Complete</strong> problem analysis was complete, identifying the problem&rsquo;s inputs, outputs, and algorithm/plan. </li>
<li><strong>Metacognition Complete</strong> means the student made an honest effort to answer the open-ended questions in the assignment.</li>

<h3 id="recitation-code-assignment-s02-s13">Recitation Code Assignment (S02 - S13)</h3>
<p>Your recitation professor will measure attendance and participation each session through you turning in your recitation code activity. This is the code you work on in class with your classmates. If you are not in class, you will not recieve credit.   The specific criteria is entirely at the discretion of your instructor, but most likely consists participating in the programming assignment completed in class. </p>
<h3 id="computational-literacy-diagnostic-c1-c2">Computational Literacy Diagnostic (C1 - C2)</h3>
<p>There are two Diagnostic exams issues in class. The purpose of these exams is to measure student&rsquo;s computational literacy skills before and after the foundational units in the course. This information is used to study the effectiveness of the course material in improving  computational literacy. These exams are not graded. Points are awarded for completion when assigned in class.</p>

<h2 id="course-specific-policies">Course Specific Policies</h2>
<h3 id="due-dates">Due Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late work is not accepted.</strong> Due to the formative nature of work in the course (practice with timely feedback), it does not make sense to accept late work. Please plan to keep pace with the course by completing your practice exercises on time.</li>
<li>Due dates are posted on the Syllabus in the <a href="#course-schedule">course schedule</a> section, specifically <a href="#whats-due">What&rsquo;s Due?</a>. Due dates are also posted in Blackboard.</li>
<li>Once again: In order to provide timely and relevant feedback, no late work is accepted. Exceptions will only be made under extreme circumstances with supporting University documentation of illness or personal reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>Earning Research Credit through the CITRA Portal</p>
<p>This course participates in the Communication, Information, and Technology Research Alliance (CITRA) Research Pool. This is a shared resource for students interested in participating in scientific research being conducted by Newhouse or iSchool faculty and students, and you can earn credit for this course in exchange for volunteering for those studies. At any time during the semester, you can visit <a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/citra">https://ischool.syr.edu/citra</a> to read more about the study participation opportunities. Note that there may not always be studies available and you might not be eligible for all studies, but that the list of studies is updated frequently so you should check for new studies throughout the semester. For each study listed there are specific instructions for how to sign up and participate—if you have questions, please email the researcher listed directly.</p>
<p>When you sign up for a CITRA Pool study, you will earn credits equal to roughly 1 credit for each 30 minutes of study-participation time (although some studies could be worth more or less, depending on what you are asked to do). Each CITRA Pool credit can be assigned only to one course, and study participation must be completed by the last class day of the semester.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to understand that it is not mandatory that you participate in research to earn course credit. If you would still like to earn course credit but are not interested in volunteering for any of the CITRA Pool studies, you may contact the coordinators of the CITRA Pool for more information about alternative credit activities. For iSchool courses, your contact is the CITRA coordinator Dr. Jaime Banks (banks@syr.edu). You may also email those contacts for any other questions, comments, or concerns you have about the CITRA Pool system.</p>
<p>Additional extra credit opportunities may be available throughout the semester. Your instructor will announce the details if they are available.</p>
<p><strong>For our particular class you are limited to earning extra 9 credits for the semester, or the equivalent of 3 practice assignments (lab, small group, or homework).</strong></p>
<h3 id="course-withdrawal">Course Withdrawal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only the main section instructor can sign a withdraw petition.</li>
<li>We will only sign a withdraw from this course based on poor academic performance (F grade).</li>
<li>You can always re-take the course and replace your failing grade with a passing grade.  </li>
<li>If you are putting in the time and effort it is very difficult to fail this course in the first place.</li>
<li>This reserves course withdraws for their original intended purpose - extreme circumstances with supporting University documentation of illness or personal reasons.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-of-ai-assistants">Use of AI Assistants</h3>
<p>Based on the assignments in this course and our specified learning outcomes, the full use of artificial intelligence as a tool, with disclosure and citation, is permitted in this course. Students do not need to ask permission to use these tools before starting an assignment, but they must explicitly and fully indicate which tools were used and describe how they were used.</p>
<h3 id="course-honor-code-academic-integrity">Course Honor Code - Academic Integrity</h3>
<p><strong>What Does Academic Integrity Mean In This Course?</strong></p>
<p>The course honor code represents our commitment to Academic Integrity in a programming course. I drafted the class honor code to avoid academic negligence - situations where students are unaware that their actions are actually a form of cheating. Our honor code remedies this problem by clearly stating the expectations of Academic Integrity for this course. It states:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All work is my own</strong>. Answers on all student work, assignments (labs, homework, problem sets, projects, papers, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) are my own individual work (except where collaboration is explicitly allowed and disclosed). In the case where collaboration is permitted I will only collaborate within my team. Your own work means it manifests your own thoughts and ideas, not someone else&rsquo;s. AI is included in the &ldquo;someone else.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>I will not share answers.</strong> I will not make answers (either my own or the professor’s) to work, assignments (labs, problem sets, projects, papers, homework, etc…) and assessments (quizzes, exams, tests, etc…) available to anyone else in or out of class. This includes posting them on the web / chegg / course hero, or sharing them in test banks.</li>
<li><strong>I will not misrepresent my ability.</strong> I will not engage in any activity which misrepresents or falsifies my knowledge of the subject matter and therefore improves my grade dishonestly. This includes unsanctioned test aids, copying homework, and assistance from unapproved sources outside of class. This includes passing off AI output as your own work.</li>
<li><strong>I will give credit.</strong> I will always pay attribution to my sources, and not misrepresent the works of others as my own. If you get code from the internet, a tutor, or an AI assistant, you must cite it like you would any source in an academic paper. If you used AI, disclose that.</li>
<li><strong>I accept the honor code and its consequences.</strong> I understand and accept that that all work I submit is subject to the honor code, and if I violate this honor code I my instructor is obligated to report me to the University&rsquo;s office of Academic Integrity. </li>
</ol>
<p>This can be easily summarized as: <strong>If code you are submitting did not originate from you, you must clearly disclose where it came from.</strong></p>
<p>When in doubt, ask. When unsure, disclose openly. Most students who get into trouble are trying to hide their academic dishonesty. Don&rsquo;t do that. We will catch you easily.</p>
<h3 id="sanctions-for-violations-of-academic-integrity">Sanctions for Violations of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Oops. I violated academic integrity. What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>All suspected academic integrity violation will be reported to the university&rsquo;s office of academic integrity.</li>
<li>Proposed sanction for violations of a low-stakes assessment such as a homework assignment or lab, is a <strong>grade of zero</strong>.</li>
<li>Proposed sanction for any violation on a summative assessment such as an exam or the final project is a <strong>grade of F in the course</strong>.</li>
